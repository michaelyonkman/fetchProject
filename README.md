# fetchProject
Coding exercise for Fetch Rewards

# Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Once inside the project repository, you need to run the command: `npm install`
to install all dependencies.
3. After `npm install` completes, you should run the command: `expo start` to start
the app. At this point a new page opens in your computer’s browser that shows a
QR code on the left hand side.
4. After you see the QR code, download the app “Expo” from the app store.
5. After completion, use the phone’s camera to point to the QR code and tap the
pop up that shows up.
7. You'll now be redirected to the app on Expo.
